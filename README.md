    - Login attempts (successful and failed)
    - Security-related warnings
- **Session Management**:
    - Secure user sessions with proper authentication
    - Last login date tracking
    - Session information persistence

### User Interface

- **JavaFX-based GUI**:
    - Clean login interface
    - Role-appropriate dashboards
    - Alert system for notifications
    - File vault browsing and management interface
- **Dynamic UI Elements**:
    - Context-sensitive screens based on user permissions
    - Intuitive navigation
    - Specialized file viewing and editing capabilities

## User Type Capabilities

### SuperAdmin

## Technical Details

### Technology Stack

- **Java 21**: Core application language
- **JavaFX**: UI framework
- **MySQL**: Backend database for user data
- **JDBC**: Database connectivity
- **Gradle**: Build system
- **Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE)**: Encryption implementation

### Security Implementation

- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- Salted hashing prevents rainbow table attacks
- Account locking for security breaches
- Password expiration policies
- AES-256 encryption for file contents
- Secure temporary file handling with automatic cleanup

### File Vault Architecture

- **Secure File Management**:
    - Files stored with encrypted names and contents
    - Dedicated vault directory separate from application files
    - Type-specific handling for different file formats
    - Internal viewer/editor for supported formats

- **Temporary File Safety**:
    - Secure creation and deletion of temporary files
    - Automatic cleanup on application exit
    - Protected viewing and editing workflow

## Database Configuration

The application connects to a MySQL database hosted on alwaysdata.net:

- Database URL: jdbc:mysql://mysql-javaguidbhosting.alwaysdata.net:3306/javaguidbhosting_userdatabase
- Username credentials are managed through the application
- Database purges occur periodically based on last login date

**Security Note**: When creating accounts, use unique credentials that aren't used for other important services.

## Using the File Vault

The file vault system provides a secure way to store sensitive files:

1. Access the vault through the "Vault" button in the dashboard (Admin and SuperAdmin access)
2. View encrypted files with appropriate viewers based on file type
3. Edit text files directly within the application
4. Open and edit other file types using your system's default applications
5. All files are automatically re-encrypted after editing
